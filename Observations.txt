Observations:

Controller Within a Controller:

1. If a variable is defined on the Parent Controller, that will be available to the Child Controller in form of prototype inheritance.

2. If the child controller do not have it own controller variable, it is inherited prototypically from the parent.

3. In case the user changes the value (Value Type) of inner controller, then the controller contains it own reference for the variable. 

4. In case a reference type variable is not available with child controller, it is inherited from the Parent Controller.

5. If value of Reference type variable is changed inside child controller, it is reflected to parent.

6. Child controller do not create it own variable for reference types.
